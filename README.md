# SpaceInvader game  
I took the game we saw in class and added the following 2 changes:  
1. The Laser gun now shoots with a cooldown of 0.5s. (LaserWithCooldown.cs)
2. The enemies in the game now follow the player instead of falling downwards.  (Chaser.cs)  
The project was copiled in Unity version 2021.3.18f1
